# MFSNet
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper titled "MFSNet: A Multi Focus Segmentation Network for Skin Lesion Segmentation" accepted in Pattern Recognition, Elsevier.

# Preprocessing
To run the script for inpainting, run the following using the command prompt:

`python inpaint.py --root "D:/inputs/" --destination "D:/images/"`

# Training the Network
Follow the directory structure as follows:

```
+-- data
|   +-- .
|   +-- train
|   |   +-- images
|   |   +-- masks
|   +-- test
|   |   +-- images
|   |   +-- masks
+-- train.py
+-- test.py
```

Run the following to train the MFSNet network:

`python train.py --train_path "data/train"`

Other available hyperparameters for training are as follows:
- `--epoch`: Number of epochs of training. Default = 100
- `--lr`: Learning Rate. Default = 1e-4
- `--batchsize`: Batch Size. Default = 20
- `--trainsize`: Size of Training images (to be resized). Default = 352
- `--clip`: Gradient Clipping Margin. Default = 0.5
- `--decay_rate`: Learning rate decay. Default = 0.05
- `--decay_epoch`: Number of epochs after which Learning Rate needs to decay. Default = 25

After the training is complete, run the following to generate the predictions on the test images:

`python test.py --test_path "data/test"`

# Evaluating Performance
Run `eval/main.m` using MATLAB on the ground truth images and the predicted masks, to get the evaluation measures.
